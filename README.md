## A PEEK INTO JARD'S LIFE✨✨


Yo! Axolotls🧙🏽‍♀️🧙🏽‍♀️

This is a personal fun project. Its purpose was to practice the concepts of three.js, making interactive cubes, but rather ended up being a fun thing.

#Alert  :  Please open in system or lappy only, cuz its aint responsive and looks crappy on small screens.🤷🏽‍♀️🤹🏽‍♀️

If u have too much of time and want to waste it, having a peek into it ain't a bad idea, but I don't reccoment it either.
